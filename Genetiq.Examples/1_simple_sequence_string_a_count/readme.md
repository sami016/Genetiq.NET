# Example 1: Simple Sequence - string A count

A simple example demonstrating the evolution of a sequence of character bytes.

This employs a random replacement mutation scheme where in each offsprint a random character from each parent is replaced with a random other character.

A simple uniform crossover scheme is used, where each sequence position (locus) has an equal chance of being from either parent.
